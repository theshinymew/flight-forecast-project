# Flight Forecast Project

A script that sends me an email containing a list of flights departing from the terminal I work at, broken down by hour. The purpose of this is to get an idea of how busy work is gonna be on a given day. By knowing how many flights depart withing a certain hour, it's easy to guess how much traffic the restaurant is gonna get. This script automates what the restaurant managers already do by hand every day.
